# Wiki-Game-Solver
A real-time navigation program over Wikipedia's articlesâ€™ graph. Implementing a bi- directional extension for the classic A* search and a variety of heuristics based on  different domains, including NLP and Graph Theory, in order to defeat a human on the popular Wiki-Game.<br>

 WikiProblem.py - this module implements the WikiProblem which serves the problem interface using the online wikipedia API. it gives more data (text, categories etc.) but is slower than the offline interface. <br>
 WikiSolver.py - this module implements all solving mechanisms it includes a node class (used for tracking depth and path of search) a "base search" that is used for running all A* variations and all heuristics used in our project.
 OnlineGamer.py - this script uses selenium in order to play online on https://thewikigame.com. It only executes code from WikiSolver. to see the agent competes with others online just run the script with no arguments.
 executor.py - this file runs the code. it allows to run a single search with a single heuristic or run a full test that writes results to a tsv file. to see the correct usage run this script with no arguments.
 sql_offline_queries.py - this module implements the OfflineWikiProblem which serves the problem interface using an offline DB that can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kf_FEVSy6z_ACcL7kqop9a6LCXAP8jKB.
 utils.py - data structures useful for implementing SearchAgents, from Pacman AI projects that were developed at UC Berkeley, and are used here for educational purposes.
 index.html - the website from this project, describing it in hebrew.
 improved_wikipedia (package) - an improvement for the popular wikipedia package, allowing quering more pages and info about pages with less requests. 
 
 for the offline heuristics download the offline DB from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kf_FEVSy6z_ACcL7kqop9a6LCXAP8jKB. Extract the file and save it near this repository, in a parent directory, under the name "sdow.sqlite".
